Description:
This is a KSP mod to change mass when choosing variants. 
Currently, you have to choose a variant as well as the intended B9PS subtype to make it work, in the part’s Part Action Window by right-clicking in the VAB or SPH.


“Full” and “Shroud” are left unchanged.

“Mid” and “Truss mount” have mass, cost, and max thrust cut by 5%. Gimbal range and crash tolerance are cut by 50%.

“Bare” have mass, cost, and max thrust cut by 10%. Gimbal range and crash tolerance are cut by 75%.

The new Poodle Variant (single bell) also gets 50% more mass, max thrust, crash tolerance and cost, with gimbal cut by 50%.

The Rover Variant of Mk2 Lander Can gets 15% less mass and monoprop capacity.


Dependency: 
Module Manager. 
B9 Part Switch.
This mod will not work without them.
