Description:
This is a KSP mod to change engine mass when choosing variants. 

“Full” and “Shroud” are left unchanged.

“Mid” and “Truss mount” have mass, cost, and max thrust cut by 5%. Gimbal range and crash tolerance are cut by 50%.

“Bare” have mass, cost, and max thrust cut by 10%. Gimbal range and crash tolerance are cut by 75%.

The new Poodle Variant (single bell) also gets 1.5 times the original mass, max thrust, crash tolerance and cost, with gimbal cut by 50%.

Dependency: Module Manager. B9 Part Switch.
This mod will not work without them.
