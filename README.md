Description:
This is a KSP mod to change engine mass when choosing variants. {WIP}

“Full” and “Shroud” are left unchanged.

“Mid” and “Truss mount” have mass, cost, and max thrust cut by 5%. Gimbal range and crash tolerance are cut by 50%.

“Bare” have mass, cost, and max thrust cut by 10%. Gimbal range and crash tolerance are cut by 75%.

Dependency: Module Manager.

Issues: All 2.5m parts didn’t work.




To-do list:
1. Add Making History engines support. {Soon}
2. Add feature of more drag when bare/mid/truss instead of shroud/full. {Soon}
3. Add “Bare” part variants to “Thud”, “Twitch”, “Rhino”. {Later}
